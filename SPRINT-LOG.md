# Sprint Log — `sprint/opencode-completion`

## S1-T1 — Verify the OpenCode automation surface

**Done:** Replaced every hypothesis in `docs/09-opencode-adapter.md` with
observed facts by probing the installed opencode 1.18.4 binary. Tested all nine
questions: surface (found three usable surfaces — one-shot CLI, HTTP server, ACP
server), auth, workspace targeting (critically confirmed opencode respects
`--dir` and cwd, unlike Antigravity), permission mapping (rich per-tool
granular system), streaming shape (structured JSON events with token usage),
structured output (YES — lead-eligible via server/SDK path with JSON Schema),
cancellation (both subprocess kill and HTTP abort), models (full catalogue with
cost/limits/variants), and binary resolution (npm shim pattern).

**Hard:** The `opencode serve` HTTP server could not be probed directly via curl
because the process startup via `Start-Process` failed on the cmd shim (it is
not a Win32 app). Had to use `Start-Job` with the direct exe path to start the
server. The Structured Output capability is only available through the
server/SDK path (`@opencode-ai/sdk`), not through the one-shot CLI — this is a
critical design constraint.

**Assumed:** That `POST /session/:id/abort` cleanly terminates work without
orphans (documented but not live-tested — would need a running server + active
session). That the SDK's `session.prompt()` with `format.json_schema` is
available in the same HTTP API (inferred from the SDK being auto-generated from
the server's OpenAPI spec). That `testing` capability (exit-code-backed) holds
because the bash tool returns real exit codes — confirmed at the permission/CLI
level but not proven with a live test run.

**Deviations:** None — all success criteria met.
