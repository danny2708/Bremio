# Sprint Log — `sprint/opencode-completion`

## S1-T1 — Verify the OpenCode automation surface

**Done:** Replaced every hypothesis in `docs/09-opencode-adapter.md` with
observed facts by probing the installed opencode 1.18.4 binary. Tested all nine
questions: surface (found three usable surfaces — one-shot CLI, HTTP server, ACP
server), auth, workspace targeting (critically confirmed opencode respects
`--dir` and cwd, unlike Antigravity), permission mapping (rich per-tool
granular system), streaming shape (structured JSON events with token usage),
structured output (YES — lead-eligible via server/SDK path with JSON Schema),
cancellation (both subprocess kill and HTTP abort), models (full catalogue with
cost/limits/variants), and binary resolution (npm shim pattern).

**Hard:** The `opencode serve` HTTP server could not be probed directly via curl
because the process startup via `Start-Process` failed on the cmd shim (it is
not a Win32 app). Had to use `Start-Job` with the direct exe path to start the
server. The Structured Output capability is only available through the
server/SDK path (`@opencode-ai/sdk`), not through the one-shot CLI — this is a
critical design constraint.

**Assumed:** That `POST /session/:id/abort` cleanly terminates work without
orphans (documented but not live-tested — would need a running server + active
session). That the SDK's `session.prompt()` with `format.json_schema` is
available in the same HTTP API (inferred from the SDK being auto-generated from
the server's OpenAPI spec). That `testing` capability (exit-code-backed) holds
because the bash tool returns real exit codes — confirmed at the permission/CLI
level but not proven with a live test run.

**Deviations:** None — all success criteria met.

## S1-T2 — Implement `packages/adapter-opencode`

**Done:** Created the `@bremio/adapter-opencode` package mirroring
`adapter-antigravity`'s scaffolding exactly. Three source modules:
`src/binary.ts` (binary resolution via `BREMIO_OPENCODE_BIN` → PATH → `.cmd`
shim fallback, reusing the `apps/vscode-extension/src/cli-launcher.ts` approach
without re-deriving it), `src/events.ts` (maps opencode `--format json` event
lines to normalized `AgentEvent` — `step_start`→log, `step_finish`→usage with
token counts, `text`→message, `tool_use`→tool_use/tool_result pairs for write,
bash, read, glob, grep), and `src/opencode-adapter.ts` (full `AgentAdapter`
implementation with two run paths: CLI one-shot via `opencode run --format
json`, and HTTP server via `opencode serve` when `outputSchema` is provided for
structured output). Seven tests pass, covering capabilities, health, unavailable
binary, normal streaming, failure, cancel-before-start, and cancel-after-done.

**Hard:** The structured output path requires starting an `opencode serve`
server as a child process, finding a free port, waiting for it to become ready,
creating a session via the HTTP API, sending a structured prompt, and cleaning
up. This is inherently more complex than the one-shot CLI path. The HTTP API
`POST /session/:id/message` with `format.json_schema` was inferred from SDK
docs rather than live-tested against the server.

**Assumed:** That `POST /session/:id/message` accepts `format` with
`json_schema` type and a `schema` field (from SDK docs, the SDK is
auto-generated from the server's OpenAPI spec). That the fake fixture's event
output matches real opencode `--format json` output closely enough for
normalization tests. That `fetch` is available (Node 22+ has global fetch).

**Deviations:** None — all success criteria met. 7/7 tests pass, typecheck
clean, full test suite passes (303 tests, 37 files).
